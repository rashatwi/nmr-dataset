Contains the optimized structure of the following:
* The top six solvation structures of Mg2+ in a 
solution of Mg(TFSI)2/DME (as conf_x.xyz); 
* Mg(H2O)6 used as a reference for the chemical shift of 25Mg; 
* (DME)n for n = (1-4);
* (DMSO)n for n = (1-4, 6);
* (H2O)n for n = (1-4, 6, 8, 10, 12)

Optimization was performed at the wB97X/Def2TZVP level of theory using the PCM 
solvation model for bulk solvent effects.
