**json-files.zip**:
* Database of chemical shifts resulting from the benchmarking study in the form of json 
files. 

**ch_shifts.csv**:
* 13C and 1H chemical shifts of the top six configurations of Mg(TFSI)2/DME at 
different DFT levels of theory using the PCM solvation model and different cluster 
sizes of DMSO and H2O as chemical references 

**ch_tensors.csv**:
* 13C and 1H isotropic chemical shieldings of the top six configurations 
of Mg(TFSI)2/DME at different DFT levels of theory using the PCM solvation model

**dme_shifts.csv**:
* 13C and 1H chemical shifts of DME in the bulk electrolyte solution 
at different DFT levels of theory and using the PCM solvation model and different 
cluster sizes of DMSO and H2O as chemical references. The "cluster" corresponds to 
the number of DME molecules considered

**dme_tensors.csv**: 
* 13C and 1H isotropic chemical shieldings of DME in the bulk electrolyte solution 
at different DFT levels of theory and using the PCM solvation model. The "cluster"
corresponds to the number of DME molecules considered 

**dmso_tensors.csv**: 
* 13C isotropic chemical shieldings of different DMSO cluster sizes (n = 1-4, 6) at 
different DFT levels of theory and using the PCM solvation model 

**mg_shifts.csv**: 
* 25Mg shifts of the top six configurations of Mg(TFSI)2/DME at different DFT levels 
of theory and using the PCM solvation model and Mg(H2O)6 as a chemical reference 

**smd.csv**: 
* 25Mg, 13C, and 1H chemical shifts of the top six configurations of Mg(TFSI)2/DME at 
the wB97X/Def2TZVP and M062X/Def2TZVP levels of theory and using the SMD solvation 
model. Mg(H2O)6, (DMSO)2, and (H2O)8 are used as the chemical references for 25Mg, 
13C, and 1H, respectively

**water_tensors.csv**: 
* 1H isotropic chemical shieldings of different water cluster sizes 
(n = 1-4, 6, 8, 10, 12) at different DFT levels of theory and using the PCM solvation 
model 

**mg_exp_spectrum.csv**:
* 25Mg chemical shift experimental data

**Note**: avg and max correspond to the type of the isotropic shielding tensor of the 
chemical reference
