Contains the optimized structure of the following:
* The top six solvation structures of Li+ in a 
solution of LiTFSI/DME (as conf_x.xyz); 
* Li(H2O)5 used as a reference for the chemical shift of 7Li; 

Optimization was performed at the wB97X/Def2TZVP level of theory using the PCM 
solvation model for bulk solvent effects.
