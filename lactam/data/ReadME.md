Gibbs free energy (kcal/mol), Boltzmann weights, absolute and weighted <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shifts (ppm) of different conformers of penam β-lactams 1 through 4 at the following levels of theory:
* B3LYP/6-311+G(2d, p)
* ωB97X/def2-TZVP

Calculations were performed in chloroform using the PCM solvation model. TMS was used as a chemical reference, with the following isotropic shielding tensors: 
| Functional    | Basis Set | <sup>13</sup>C Isotropic Shielding Tensor (ppm)| <sup>1</sup>H Isotropic Shielding Tensor (ppm)
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| B3LYP  | 6-311+G(2d, p) | 183.737 | 31.940
| ωB97X | def2-TZVP | 191.218 | 31.9026
